Elastoman version 0.1.0
=======================

Elastoman is a tool for managing ElasticSearch instances. It is aimed at
administrators and developers alike.


INSTALLATION

You need to have Java installed.

Use of perlbrew is recommended. To install it just run:

  curl -kL http://install.perlbrew.pl | bash
  source ~/perl5/perlbrew/etc/bashrc
  perlbrew available (this lists all available versions of perl, use a 
                      stable one)
  perlbrew install <the version you chose, recommended 5.16.x>
  perlbrew use <your version of perl>
  perlbrew install cpanm

Once you got a perl environment just for your user its time to install
Elastoman's dependencies. Simply run:

  cpanm YAML::Tiny
  cpanm JSON

Next you need to create your configuration files. Use the templates:

  indexes.json.dist
  instances.yml.dist
  
Edit them and save them without the .dist extension.

That's it. Read the documentation on how to edit configuration files and
setup your instances, indexes, mappings and test documents.
